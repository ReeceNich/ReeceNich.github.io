Below are some projects I have created which you may be interesting in checking out.

## Python Learning Game
The goal for this project was to create a mini-game which students can use as a revision/learning tool for school subjects. The mini-game is two-dimensional and orientated around learning, whilst at the same time aiming to give the students an interactive and fun way to engage in learning.

## Burgee Collection
A burgee is a flag given to a sailing club. With the help of my Grandad, we have photographed and catalogued all the burgees collected by the Island Sailing Club over the years. You can check out the collection and the website we have built by clicking the link.

## Speed Limits
A simple web toy which uses your GPS location to inform you of the current speed limit of the road you are on.
